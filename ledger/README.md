### Local testing

For local development, start by running a hardhat node.
This mimics the Ethereum blockchain, allowing us to deploy and test smart contracts.

```
npx hardhat node
```

To run a local script against this node:

```
npx hardhat run path/to/script.ts
```

### Contracts

All smart contracts can be found in the `contracts` directory.
